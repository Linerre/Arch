# Xorg
**Xorg** is basically **X Windows System**. People simply refer to it as **X**. But do not get it wrong:
1. It is *Not* a Desktop Environment (DE, for example, GNOME, KDE) or an Operating System (say Windows, macOS). 
2. Rather, it is the very system that controls your input devices such as the keyborad & mourse and output device such as the screen.

I as a user will first need to start X before I can use a DE. Then What if I do not start X?
If I do not start X, then after I start my laptop/PC:
1. I need to log in as a user, say `root` user.
2. I will then be landed on sth called **Console**, where only white-color text can be typed onto the black-background screen as commands, and the machine may or may not output text to the screen depending on what commands I use. Yeap, very like a **Terminal Emulator**, but it is not.
3. No hint of how and where a mouse cursor could be used.

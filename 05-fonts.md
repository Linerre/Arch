# Fonts
In terminal I prefer Manaco and Hack font. Both are TrueType Fonts yet the former is not free and open source. 
It can be downloaded from AUR and then installed, though.

## Firefox & CJK
When I first installed firefox and tried to browse some pages, it rendered pages (say, Bing and Google) [in this way](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Incomplete_support_for_Japanese_script.png?1577608120194). 

This is because my OS lacks CJK fonts. In the Arch source repo there is [a very small list](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=CJK&maintainer=&flagged=) of CJK fonts.

I just chose Adobe-source-han and after the installation, the firefox worked beautifully.

# Installation and Rice
This repo, *a work in progress*, holds my notes (in the `Notes` dir) about installing and configurating my Arch Linux. The notes have been divided into sections corresponding to the stages during my Arch journey:
1. [Installation in general](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/00-installation.md)
2. [Xorg](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/01-xorg.md)
3. [urxvt](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/02-urxvt.md)
4. [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/03-i3wm.md)
5. [network](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/04-network.md)
6. [fonts](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/05-fonts.md)
7. [partitioning](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/06-partitioning.md)

## obsolete content
I will take down the important steps during installing Arch Linux in this repo, such as:
1. Installation;
2. Connecting to WiFi
3. Set up a normal user account for myself
4. Setting up ~~Dispaly Manager~~ `xinit`, Window Manager and Terminal emulator.
5. Setting up development environment for several programming languages (JS, Python, R, C, etc)
6. Learning `pacman`
7. Re-partitioning my hard drive so to:
  - move `/home` to another drive
  - delete and or resize the `sawp` partition?
  - enlarge `/boot` (from 300MB to 1GB?)

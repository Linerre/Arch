# Installation and Rice

## Purposes
That I entered the world of Arch Linux was largely inspired by Luke Smith's videos on
Linux, Vim, and Latex. 

I want to rely on this Arch Linux for three purposes:
1. Learning Linux. There is no doubt that Arch will serve this purpose very well.
2. Trying out new features. 
3. Switching to Linux as my daily driver.
4. Moving towards a more independent lifestyle.

## obsolete content
I will take down the important steps during installing Arch Linux in this repo, such as:
1. Installation;
2. Connecting to WiFi
3. Set up a normal user account for myself
4. Setting up ~~Dispaly Manager~~ `xinit`, Window Manager and Terminal emulator.
5. Setting up development environment for several programming languages (JS, Python, R, C, etc)
6. Learning `pacman`
7. Re-partitioning my hard drive so to:
  - move `/home` to another drive
  - delete and or resize the `sawp` partition?
  - ~~enlarge `/boot` (from 300MB to 1GB?)~~

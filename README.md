I will take down the important steps during installing Arch Linux in this repo, such as:
1. Installation;
2. Connecting to WiFi
3. Setting up ~~Dispaly Manager~~ `xinit`, Window Manager and Terminal emulator.
4. Setting up development environment for several programming languages.
5. Learning `pacman`
6. Re-partitioning my hard drive so to:
  - move `/home` to another drive
  - delete `sawp`?
  - enlarge `/boot` (from 300MB to 1GB?)

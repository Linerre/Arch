# Installation and Rice

## Latest

I am using both Arch and Artix now. 
I must start learning C as early as possible.

~~**Arch has a great mirrolist, whicn ensures the rolling update. Artix, however, is not working very well under some conditions when the network connetion often fails to get the updates.**~~
I can of course change my mirror site and rely heavily on the great arch mirrors.

~~Arch KDE for python and hacking learning, say Lisp.~~
Void for config learning
start a new journey
Keep moving

## A Work in Progress
This repo, *a work in progress*, holds my notes (in the `Notes` dir) about installing and configurating my Arch Linux. The notes have been divided into sections corresponding to the stages during my Arch journey:
1. [Installation in general](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/00-installation.md)
2. [Xorg](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/01-xorg.md)
3. [urxvt](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/02-urxvt.md)
4. [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/03-i3wm.md)
5. [network](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/04-network.md)
6. [fonts](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/05-fonts.md)
7. [partitioning](https://github.com/Linerre/Arch/blob/master/Notes/06-partitioning.md)

## obsolete content
I will take down the important steps during installing Arch Linux in this repo, such as:
1. Installation;
2. Connecting to WiFi
3. Set up a normal user account for myself
4. Setting up ~~Dispaly Manager~~ `xinit`, Window Manager and Terminal emulator.
5. Setting up development environment for several programming languages (JS, Python, R, C, etc)
6. Learning `pacman`
7. Re-partitioning my hard drive so to:
  - move `/home` to another drive
  - delete and or resize the `sawp` partition?
  - ~~enlarge `/boot` (from 300MB to 1GB?)~~

# Installation and Rice
This repo, *a work in progress*, holds my notes (in the `Notes` dir) about installing and configurating my Arch Linux. The notes have been divided into sections corresponding to the stages during my Arch journey:
0. Installation in general
1. Xorg
2. urxvt
3. i3-gaps
4. network
5. fonts
6. re-partioning
(to be continued)

## obsolete content
I will take down the important steps during installing Arch Linux in this repo, such as:
1. Installation;
2. Connecting to WiFi
3. Set up a normal user account for myself
4. Setting up ~~Dispaly Manager~~ `xinit`, Window Manager and Terminal emulator.
5. Setting up development environment for several programming languages (JS, Python, R, C, etc)
6. Learning `pacman`
7. Re-partitioning my hard drive so to:
  - move `/home` to another drive
  - delete and or resize the `sawp` partition?
  - enlarge `/boot` (from 300MB to 1GB?)

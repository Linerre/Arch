# Installation and Rice

## Purposes
That I entered the world of Arch Linux was largely inspired by Luke Smith's videos on
Linux, Vim, and LaTeX. 

I want to benefit from Arch Linux because:
1. it is a good starting point for learning Linux.
3. I'd like to switch to Linux and use it as my daily driver.
4. I'd like to move towards a more independent lifestyle.

# Notes on the Arch Installation Guide
## Why and What
As a newbie to Arch, the installation can be scary, for several reasons:

1. As a newbie I have been used to GUI for years. Even when faced with some techinical issues from time to time, I know there are a whole bunch of tutorials with step-by-step screenshots. **But Arch Wiki does not do that; just text instructions**.
2. Though I have been more of less feeling comfortable with CLI, the tutorials I favor are the ones that kindly show the outputs information enusing the commands. **But, again, this is NOT often the case with Arch Wiki.** Instead, it tends to just tell you what commands are needed to do what and that's all.
3. As Arch Wiki is fairly information-intensive, as ifself said:
> ... it may be necessary to examine several relates sources in order to fully understand an ArchWiki article. In particular, users who are new to Arch (or GNU/Linux in general) should expect to end up reading a great number of articles even when solving simple problems.
Once used to solving a problem by closely following user-friendly instructions in one singel article, no longer.

Being concise is Arch; yet I do think it is helpful to extend the ArchWiki a little bit by adding some notes whenever I feel necessary. And is my notes for Arch's [Installation Guide](wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide)
